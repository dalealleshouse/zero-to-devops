## Abstract
The benefits of containerization cannot be overstated. Tools like Docker have
made working with containers easy, efficient, and even enjoyable. However,
management at scale is still a considerable task. Thats why theres Kubernetes.
Come see how easy it is to create a manageable container environment. Live on
stage (demo gods willing) youll witness a full Kubernetes configuration using
the Google Cloud platform (Kubernetes also runs in Azure or Amazon). In less
than an hour, well build an environment capable of: Automatic Binpacking,
Instant Scalability, Self-healing, Rolling Deployments, and Service
Discovery/Load Balancing.
