# Zero to DevOps in Under an Hour with Kubernetes 

This repo contains the code presented in the talk. Slides available [here](http://slides.com/dalealleshouse/kube)

## Abstract
The benefits of containerization cannot be overstated. Tools like Docker have
made working with containers easy, efficient, and even enjoyable. However,
management at scale is still a considerable task. That's why there's Kubernetes.
Come see how easy it is to create a manageable container environment. Live on
stage (demo gods willing) you'll witness a full Kubernetes configuration. In
less than an hour, we'll build an environment capable of: Automatic Binpacking,
Instant Scalability, Self-healing, Rolling Deployments, and Service
Discovery/Load Balancing.
